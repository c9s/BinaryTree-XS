=head1 NAME

Tree::Binary::XS - Perl extension for manipulating binary tree structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tree::Binary::XS;
  my $tree = Tree::Binary::XS->new({ by_key => 'id' });

  $tree->insert({ foo => 'bar', id => 11 });

  $tree->insert([{ foo => 'bar', id => 11 }, ... ]);

  $ret->exists(10);
  $ret->exists({ id => 10, 'name' => 'Bob' });

  # Use specified key instead of the key from payload
  $tree->insert(10, { foo => 'bar' });

  # to insert multiple keys one time.
  @ret = $tree->insert_those([{ id => 10, 'name' => 'Bob' },  { id => 3, 'name' => 'John' }, { id => 2, 'name' => 'Hank' } ]);

  $tree->update(10, { foo => 'bar' })

  $n = $tree->search(10);

  $tree->exists(10);
  $tree->exists({ foo => 'bar' , id => 10 });

  $tree->inorder_traverse(sub { 
        my ($key, $node) = @_;
    });

  $tree->postorder_traverse(sub { 
        my ($key, $node) = @_;
    });

  $tree->preorder_traverse(sub { 
        my ($key, $node) = @_;
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please note this extension is not compatible with the L<Tree::Binary> package,
this module was redesigned and simplified the interface of manipulating tree
structure.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item $tree = Tree::Binary::XS->new({  by_key => $field_name })

The C<new> method constructs the Tree object, you may specify the C<by_key> option to let L<Tree::Binary::XS> 
get the key from the inserted objects.

=item $tree->insert(hashref $object)

Once you've defined the C<by_key>, you can simply pass the object to the insert method, for example:

    $tree->insert({
        id => 11,
        name => 'John',
    });

And C<11> will be the key of the object.

=item $tree->insert(IV key, hashref $object)

If you want to specify another key to insert the object, you may pass the C<key> as the first argument of the C<insert> method.

=item @ret = $tree->insert_those([ $obj1, $obj2, ... ])

=item $tree->update(IV key, $new_object)

=item $tree->exists(IV key)

=item $tree->exists(hashref $object)

=item $tree->search(IV key)

=item $tree->search(hashref $object)
